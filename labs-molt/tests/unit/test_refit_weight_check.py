"""`--train.check_weight_update_equal` finds the weights a refit broadcast never landed on.

vLLM's ``load_weights`` returns the params it assigned; anything it holds and never assigned
kept its old value and makes the rollout stale. The one trap is the namespace: a vLLM model
may report the pre-mapping or the fused name rather than its own parameter's, and then the
set difference accuses the whole model. So the diff is reported only when the reported names
really are its parameters.
