"""vLLM weight refit for the FSDP2/AutoModel backend.

Owns *how* to materialize each pushed parameter (``gather_full_param``): under
FSDP2, params are ``DTensor`` instances whose ``.full_tensor()`` gathers the
unsharded tensor across both FSDP shard and TP shard dims in one call.

The sender (``trainer/workers/policy_actor.py``) pushes every ``state_dict``
entry — vLLM's ``load_weights`` matches by name and ignores what it doesn't have,
so the "which weights to accept" decision lives on the vLLM side.

    Returns ``(full_tensor, full_shape)`` where ``full_tensor`` is on the local
    device with all mesh dims gathered. For non-DTensor params (e.g., the value
    head we don't shard, or buffers), returns ``(param.data, param.shape)``.

    Caller invokes this on each rank; ``full_tensor`` is replicated. Memory cost
    is the size of the full tensor on every participating rank — acceptable for
    weight refit (one-shot per training step). For very large models the async RL
    path uses per-tensor streaming with a ping-pong buffer to bound peak memory.
