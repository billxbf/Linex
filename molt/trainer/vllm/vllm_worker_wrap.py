        order; here we split + reinterpret-cast back. Replaces thousands of
        per-tensor RPC+broadcast pairs with a handful of ~1 GiB ones.

        Dtype-faithful: each meta carries the sender's own per-param dtype, which
        may differ from ``model_config.dtype`` (e.g. an fp32-kept MoE router/gate).
        We reconstruct each tensor at its *sent* dtype

        ``load_weights``, which casts to that param's target dtype via

        here — the old assert forced every weight through bf16 and silently
        downcast fp32-kept params, corrupting routing.
